## Testing Protocol

### Testing Rules:
1. MUST ALWAYS READ and UPDATE this file before invoking testing agents
2. MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
3. After backend testing, STOP to ask user permission for frontend testing
4. ONLY test frontend with user permission using `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
5. NEVER invoke testing agents without reading this file first
6. ALWAYS take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file
7. NEVER fix something that has already been fixed by testing agents
8. READ and ADHERE to the "Incorporate User Feedback" section

## Test History

### Current Issue Investigation:
**Date**: 2025-07-17
**Problem**: Equipment selection Continue button remains disabled, preventing workout builder progress
**Investigation**: Found enum mismatches between mock data and equipment configuration
**Fix**: Update mock data equipment values to match configuration enum values

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User reported preview not loading - resolved by troubleshoot_agent (frontend service was stopped)
- User needs equipment selection to work for demo functionality
- Testing should be minimal and focused on core functionality

## Original Problem Statement
The user needs to fix the equipment selection issue in the workout builder where the Continue button remains disabled even after selecting equipment. This prevents users from progressing through the demo workflow.
