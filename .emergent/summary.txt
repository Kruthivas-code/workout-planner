The AI engineer's work involved a multi-faceted approach to stabilize and enhance the MuscleMap application. Initially, critical infrastructure issues were addressed: a PostgreSQL installation, user, and path configuration error within Supervisor, and resolving Next.js cross-origin domain blocking in . Despite attempts to debug a persistent Continue button disabled issue in the workout builder (linked to  still querying a database despite being mocked, and unresponsive UI elements), the task was paused by user intervention. The focus then shifted entirely to significant UI/UX overhauls: a comprehensive removal of dark mode across the entire application's styling and components, followed by relocating the 'Premium' feature to a prominent top-navbar button and improving sidebar navigation contrast. These latter UI changes were successfully completed and verified.

The application, MuscleMap (formerly Workout.cool), is an MVP fitness coaching platform built with Next.js, React, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS. The user requested several improvements and fixes:
1.  Resolve front-end hydration and HTTP 502 errors.
2.  Rebrand to MuscleMap with an updated bicep curl icon.
3.  Transition to a responsive web layout, moving the bottom navigation to a left sidebar on larger screens.
4.  Remove top bar branding and the bottom footer.
5.  Fix Error loading exercises by ensuring database connectivity and data display.
6.  Replace complex background gradients with solid light grey () and dark black () colors.
7.  Disable authentication features for a static/demo version.
8.  Refine the Workout Builder layout: move the progress bar and CTA outside the main card, make CTAs sticky, change the dark blue CTA background to light black, and remove the main card container's background/border.
9.  **Recently added**: Completely remove dark mode, enforcing a light theme with white/very light gray backgrounds and dark text.
10. **Recently added**: Remove 'Premium' from the sidebar, add a primary-styled 'Premium' button to the top navbar on the left side, and increase the contrast of inactive sidebar items with noticeable hover effects.

-   **Fix Equipment Selection Issue:** The Continue button on the equipment selection step remains disabled, preventing progression through the demo workflow. This is due to issues with the mocked exercise data not being properly consumed or the equipment selection logic not correctly updating the state to enable the button.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed two major UI/UX enhancements. Firstly, dark mode functionality was entirely removed from the MuscleMap application. This involved systematically stripping all  utility classes, dark theme configurations from , and associated CSS variables from . Key components like the main , , , and all workout builder UI elements (e.g., , ) were updated to consistently enforce a light theme with white or very light gray backgrounds and dark text. The  component was removed, and theme providers (, ) were configured for light-only.

Secondly, the Premium feature's presentation was overhauled. The 'Premium' item was removed from the sidebar navigation by modifying . Instead, a visually prominent, golden-gradient Premium button with a crown icon was added to the top-left section of the navbar in , featuring bold text and hover effects. Concurrently, the contrast of inactive sidebar items was significantly improved, changing  to  and enhancing hover states for better visibility in  and . Both these changes were visually confirmed as implemented.
